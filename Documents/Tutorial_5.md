## DDS Manager error handling.

---

In order to use the AMM Library, this header must be included.
```
#include <amm_std.h>
```




This tutorial will explain how to use error handling on all of DDS Manager's methods.

Create an instance of DDS Manager.
```
AMM::DDSManager<void>* mgr = new AMM::DDSManager<void>("Config/Config.xml");
```

###### Error Code
Initialize Assessment catching for any errors it might return.
```
int err = mgr->InitializeAssessment();
```

Every method in DDS Manager will return an error code.
It's up to the end user if they want to acknowledge the return value or not.

> **NOTE:**\
There are no special error codes. It's either 0 for success or 1 for failure.

Handle the error.
```
if (err != 0) {
   std::cout << "Something went wrong with Initialize Assessment." << std::endl;
}
```


###### Error Message
Every method in DDS Manager also has an overload for receiving error messages.
The first argument in each method is a valid overload for error messages.

Declare container for message.
```
std::string errmsg = "";
```

Provide container as first argument.
```
err = mgr->InitializeAssessment(errmsg);
```

Handle error.
```
if (err != 0) {
   // Output the error message using your favorite logging API.
   std::cout << errmsg << std::endl;
}
```

This implementation takes a reference to an string type and writes a message to it.

Not every message written is describing an error.
An error message will be written if the method returns 1, meaning something went wrong and the routine couldn't be successfully completed.

In some instances when methods return 0, they'll also write an attention message based on how the routine returned 0. This means that the whole routine doesn't need to execute again, and therefore exits early with 0 and a message describing why.

For example: calling Initialize Assessment twice in a row.
The first invocation will return 0 and write no message, however a second invocation immediately after the first will return 0 with a message saying that it's already initialized and doesn't need to be initialized again -- hence the return of 0 with a message.


Output errmsg if it contains anything.
```
if (errmsg.length() > 0) {

   std::cout << errmsg << std::endl;
}
```
> **NOTE:**\
This second call of Initialize Assessment will generate a message taht Assessment is already initialized.


###### Complete Error Handling
Going through the rest of establishing Assessment.
```
errmsg = "";

// Inline invocation in a single statement to catch error.
if (mgr->CreateAssessmentPublisher(errmsg) != 0) {

   // Output error message.
   std::cout << errmsg << std::endl;
}
```

Definition for receiver.
```
void OnAssessmentEvent (AMM::Assessment& assessment, eprosima::fastrtps::SampleInfo_t* info) {
   std::cout << "Assessment received!" << std::endl;
}
```

Same for creating the subscriber
```
if (mgr->CreateAssessmentSubscriber(errmsg, &OnAssessmentEvent) != 0) {

   // Output error message.
   std::cout << errmsg << std::endl;
}
```

> **NOTE:**\
If DDS Manager were declared with a type and Create Subscriber needed a reference to
a receiver object, this would be how the errmsg overload is expressed:\
`mgr->CreateAssessmentSubscriber(errmsg, &foo, &Foo:OnEvent);`\
As mentioned, the errmsg overload always takes the first argument, and everything else
second and/or third as the otherwise normally would.

Generate Assessment data.
```
AMM::Assessment a;
```

Send Assessment data to the Assessment writer.
```
if (mgr->WriteAssessment(errmsg, a) != 0) {

   // Output error message.
   std::cout << errmsg << std::endl;
}
```
